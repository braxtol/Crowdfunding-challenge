Assignment

Submit a report that draws three conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns, acknowledges
certain limitations of the dataset, and proposes additional tables and/or graphs that could be created
along with the value they would provide.

Conclusions

Based on the dataset of 1000 instances of crowdfunding campaigns, one may draw the following
conclusions:
1) Campaigns with goals that range from $15,000 to $34,999 have a high success rate of 92%
(35 out of 38 successful campaigns.)
2) Campaigns launched in the summer months of June and July have a high rate of successfully
reaching their goals while campaigns created in the fall months of September and October
failed the least.
3) Plays are the most common crowdfunding campaigns. but only have a 54% chance of
success.

Limitations
There are a few limitations that must be acknowledged:
1) The sub-categories of Audio and World Music have too few instances to make a full analysis
of success versus failure for these styles of campaigns.
2) There are too few instances to make any inferences for the ratio of success/failure or goal
amount for the category of Journalism.
3) The small quantity of campaigns with goals above 10,000 and below $50,000 (84) compared
to below $10,000 (597) and above $50,000 (305) makes the “Outcome Based on Goal” chart
skewed in the middle.



Proposed Additional Data and Graphs
The following could provide additional insight into crowdfunding:
1) Scatter Plots of Sub-Categories versus % Funded might add insight into the type of
campaigns that meet and exceed their goal.
2) Pivot Table comparing if the campaign had a ”true” value of Spotlight against Outcome
could shed light on if being Spotlighted is beneficial to the success of a campaign.
3) Pivot Table comparing if the campaign had a ”true” value of Staff Pick against Outcome
could shed light on if being a Staff Pick is beneficial to the success of a campaign.
